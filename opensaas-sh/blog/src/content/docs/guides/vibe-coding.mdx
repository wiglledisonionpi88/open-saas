If you're looking to use AI to help build (or "vibe code") your SaaS app, this guide is for you.

## Coding with AI, Open SaaS, & Wasp

Wasp is particularly well suited to coding with AI due to its central config file which gives LLMs context about the entire full-stack app, and its ability to manage boilerplate code so AI doesn't have to. 

Regardless, there are still some shortcomings to using AI to code with Wasp, as well as a learning curve to using it effectively.

Luckily, we did the work for you and put together a bunch of resources to help you use Wasp & Open SaaS with AI as effectively as possible.

### AI Resources in the Template

The template comes with:
- A full set of rules files, `app/.cursor/rules`, to be used with Cursor or adapted to your coding tool of choice (Windsurf, Claude Code, etc.).
- A set of example prompts, `app/.cursor/example-prompts.md`, to help you get started.

### LLM-Friendly Documentation

We've also created a bunch of LLM-friendly documentation:
- [Open SaaS Docs - LLMs.txt](https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms.txt) - Links to the raw text docs.
- **[Open SaaS Docs - LLMs-full.txt](https://docs.opensaas.sh/llms-full.txt) - Complete docs as one text file.** âœ…ðŸ˜Ž
- Coming Soon! ~~[Wasp Docs - LLMs.txt](https://wasp.sh/llms.txt)~~ - Links to the raw text docs.
- Coming Soon! ~~[Wasp Docs - LLMs-full.txt](https://wasp.sh/llms-full.txt)~~ - Complete docs as one text file.

Add these to your AI-assisted IDE settings so you can easily reference them in your chat sessions with the LLM.
**In most cases, you'll want to pass the `llms-full.txt` to the LLM and ask it to help you with a specific task.**
